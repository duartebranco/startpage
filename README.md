# Duarte's Startpage

This page is my fork from [here](https://github.com/fxzzi/startpage).

It uses the colors from `colors.css` which is the generated file from [pywal](https://github.com/eylles/pywal16).
Every time you use pywal, you must copy the file (or create a symlink) from `.cache/wal/colors.css` to the `src/theme/colors.css` to update the colors.

It also shows the `wallpaper.[extension]` image at the left, which I put as my wallpaper.
So, it's also needed to copy or make a symlink from your curent wallpaper's path to `src/theme/wallpaper.[extension]`.

I also made a searchbox who redirects to Google.

Clone it, fork it, change it and do whatever you want with this project.

## TODO

- Add other search engines to the searchbox
